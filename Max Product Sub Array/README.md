# Subarrays in Arrays

A subarray, also known as a contiguous subarray, is a sequence of elements within an array that preserves the order of the elements. In other words, a subarray is formed by selecting a range of elements from the original array without changing their relative order.

## Definition
Subarrays are formed by selecting a range of elements from the original array without changing their relative order. This means that the elements in a subarray are consecutive and appear in the same order as they do in the original array.

## Example
Consider the following array:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Possible subarrays of this array include:
- [1]
- [1, 2]
- [1, 2, 3]
- [1, 2, 3, 4]
- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- [2]
- [2, 3]
- [2, 3, 4]
- [2, 3, 4, 5]
- [3]
- [3, 4]
- [3, 4, 5]
- [4]
- [4, 5]
- [5]

## Order Preservation
Each subarray maintains the order of the elements as they appear in the original array. This means that the elements within a subarray are consecutive and appear in the same sequence as they do in the original array.

## Usage
Subarrays are commonly used in algorithms and programming tasks for various purposes, such as finding specific patterns or sequences, calculating sums or averages within a range of elements, or optimizing array manipulation operations.
