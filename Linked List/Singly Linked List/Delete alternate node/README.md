## Delete Alternate Nodes in Singly Linked List

### Problem Statement

Given a Singly Linked List of integers, delete all the alternate nodes in the list.

#### Example

**Input:**  
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60 -> -1

Alternate nodes will be: 20, 40, and 60.  
Hence after deleting, the list will be:  
**Output:**  
Alternate nodes will be: 20, 40, and 60.  
Hence after deleting, the list will be:  
**Output:**  
10 -> 30 -> 50 -> -1


#### Input Format

The first and the only line of input will contain the elements of the Singly Linked List separated by a single space and terminated by -1.

#### Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 10^6, where N is the size of the Singly Linked List
- Time Limit: 1 second

#### Output Format

The only line of output will contain the updated list elements.
